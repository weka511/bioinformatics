   Finding All Similar Motifs

   Given: A positive integer k,
            a DNA string s of length at most 5 kbp representing a motif,
            and a DNA string t of length at most 50 kbp representing a genome.

           Return: All substrings t' of t such that the edit distance dE(s,t') is less than or equal to k.
           Each substring should be encoded by a pair containing its location in t followed by its length.

     The following code is an attempt to see wther we can execure the Manhattan algorithm for rosalind data
     within 5 minutes (300 seconds). It looks as if this isn't possible.

     4900 iterations along t axis required 456 sec, so all of th will need 3934 sec.
