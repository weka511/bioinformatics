def kmp(s):
    '''
    A prefix of a length n string s is a substring s[1:j]; a suffix of s is a substring s[k:n]

    The failure array of s
    is an array P of length n for which P[k] is the length of the longest substring s[j:k]
    that is equal to some prefix s[1:k-j+1], where j cannot equal 1 (otherwise, P[k] would always equal k). By convention, P[1]=0
