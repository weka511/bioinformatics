# scsp
#
# Find a shortest common supersequence to two sequences
#
# Paramaters: a One sequence as a string
#             b The other sequence
#
# Returns: String - shortest common supersequence to a and b
#
# Strategy: find an alignment, using a scoring matrix that penalizes mismatches severely,
#           but does not penalize indels. Then extend because there may be a few missed characters
#           at the start of either string

      #              original   Original before alignmnet
      #              pad_me     Companion - will be padded with leading spaces
      #
      # Returns: two strings, the first extended, the second padded
