def AdaptSmallParsimonyToUnrootedTrees(N,T):
    '''
    When the position of the root in an evolutionary tree is unknown,
    we can simply assign the root to any edge that we like, apply
    SmallParsimony from "Implement SmallParsimony" to the resulting rooted tree, and then remove the root.
    It can be shown that this method provides a solution to the following problem.

        Assign a root to the tree.

        Initially I followed Igor Segota's solution from
        https://stepik.org/lesson/10335/step/12?course=Stepic-Interactive-Text-for-Week-3&unit=8301,
        but found that a random root  generally led to problems with the Small Parsimony algorithm.
        Using the last node as one half of the broken lenk works well.
